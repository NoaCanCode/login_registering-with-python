# login_registering-with-python
Using python, I coded a login/register code where accounts and user data can be safed in a json file. 
Currently in v1.3 of the codes, codes can now:
- Comprehend usernames (Last time it was cap sensitive)
- alnum func codes were improved/shortened
- Encrypting/Decrypting codes
- Confm password when password entered once

Please give me feedback!
